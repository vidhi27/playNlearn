<strong>Play-N-Learn</strong>

Play N Learn is a node based application as a part of a project.

Concept
-To educate kids ranging from 7-12 years old about the coding terminology and definitions
-To introduce the coding terms by making them play three games at three different levels
 -Levels: Beginner, Intermediate, Expert
 -Games: Trivia, Fill in the Blanks, Memory Game
-Our idea about the app is all about educating them, so we decided not to give them scores like pass or fail..it will just take in the progress for the completion of the tasks. We want them to remember the terms

Technologies Used
-HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP, Materialize
-Node.js, Express, Bcrypt
-MySQL, Sequelize

Future Development
-Implementing Bcrypt fully
-Introducing games to other languages like CSS, JAVASCRIPT
-Introcuding visual games so the kids can run the code or watch and learn
-Adding progress report
